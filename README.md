# 📘 Order Book Simulation

This project simulates a limit order book using real LOB message and orderbook data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a basic Streamlit app for visualizing the book dynamics.

## 📁 Structure

- `EDA/` — Notebooks showing the exploratory data analysis on the datasets
- `streamlit/` — Streamlit app for interactive visualization
- `engine/` — Core logic for the order book simulation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. ✅ Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ To launch the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run streamlit
